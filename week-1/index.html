    <p>One interesting thing that I did on my break was a lot of cooking. I love to cook as 
        much as I can and having some time off from school I was able to get some more time in. 
        I made a few different things including poutine, spagetti, pizza, chicken stir fry,
        and beef stew. All homemade!
